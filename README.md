## Workflow Explanation

### 1. Data Loading
- The training and testing datasets are loaded into the environment.
- The dataset structure is examined to ensure correctness.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Pixel values are normalized to fall within the range [0, 1].
- Training data is split into training and validation sets for effective model evaluation.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of digits to understand dataset balance.
- Analyzed pixel intensity patterns to identify key features.

### 4. Model Selection
- Selected suitable machine learning models for digit classification.
- Experimented with various algorithms and configurations.

### 5. Model Training
- Trained models on the processed training dataset.
- Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation to improve performance.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the trained model on the validation dataset.
- Used metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for assessment.

### 7. Predictions
- Generated predictions on the test dataset.
- Submitted results for external evaluation.
